# Starving Artists Auto Painter

This is a tool that allows you to auto-paint images in the Roblox game "Starving Artists".

This is a hobby project and will most likely not be maintained.

## Features

1) Adapts to screen resolution
2) Easy-to-use interface
3) Import images by file, web or API
4) Undetected by the anti-cheat
5) Ability to use all custom brushes
6) Earn real money!

## Usage

Firstly, join the [Starving Artists game](https://www.roblox.com/games/8916037983/starving-artists-DONATION-GAME#!/about) and claim a booth. Sit down at the painting seat and then start the program. Ensure that full-screen is disabled.

In your terminal, navigate the menu.
By going the **custom** image route, you can:
- Upload an image by file
- Grab image by URL

Alternative, you can generate a **random** image with options for:
- Completely random
- Grayscale
- Blurred

<div align="left">
    <img src="screenshots/main.png" alt="Starving Artists Auto Painter" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>

Once you've uploaded the image of choice, all you have to do is type **y** to start painting! The program will automatically resize your screen and click on each pixel in order. If you ever need to force-quit, just press **Control+Alt+Delete**.

That's it! Happy painting :)
